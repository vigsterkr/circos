#
# rx1 - first regular expression selects first chromosome in link
# rx2 - second regular expression selects second chromosome in link
# avg - average number of links between chromosome pair selected by rx1,rx2
# sd  - standard deviation of number of links between chromosome pair selected by rx1,rx2

#
# rules are applied in the following order,
#
# - from least to most specific, and if of the same specificity
# - from largest to smallest sampling values
#
# in other words, rules that apply to the largest number of chromosome pairs
# are applied first

#
# rule = . . 10 5  
# rule = chr10 . 20 5
# rule = chr10 . 20 5 0.2 (triggers 20% of the time)
# rule = chr10 . r2
# rule = chr10 . r2 - 0.1 (triggers 10% of the time, - indicates unused field)

# is given avg=10,sd=5 links. Let's say that the random number chosen with
# these parameters is 12. This pair is also matched by the rule below which 
# applies a relative multipler of 3 to the number of links. Thus, chr10 chr3
