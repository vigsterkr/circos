# This is the main configuration file for the Circos tableviewer. This file also
# depends on colors.conf (definition on basic colors), ideogram.conf (size and spacing of
# row/cell segments), and ticks.conf (tick spacing and label definitions - these are turned
# off by default).
#
# In addition to these configuration files, the bin/make-conf script creates 
# colors.conf (colors of row/col segments) and colors_percentile.conf (colors based on
# cell percentile values). These configuration files are also included via the <<include>> directive.
#
# Some elements of the output image are toggled off by default (e.g. row and column highlights, 
# anchor links to segment labels, tick marks).
