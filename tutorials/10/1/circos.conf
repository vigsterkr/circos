# If a url uses a variable field, such as [id], and
# the corresponding parameter (e.g. id) is not defined,
# then 
# - if image_map_missing_parameter=exit, Circos will exit with an error
# - if image_map_missing_parameter=removeparam (or not defined), the
#      undefined parameter string will be removed
# - if image_map_missing_parameter=removeurl, url will not be used 
#      for that data point or data set

#image_map_missing_parameter = exit

# This is the name of the map, which will appear in the
# <map name="NAME"> tag of the map
image_map_name     = circosmap

# The image map will be written to this file. If this
# value is not defined, then the filename will be used
# with an html extension. If the file specified here
# does not have a directory component, the output
# directory defined by the dir parameter (see above)
# will be prefixed (i.e. the map and image will be
# created in the same directory).

#image_map_file     = circos-tutorial.html

# If urls are not preceeded by a protocol, then this
# protocol will be automatically added to each url. This is
# not strictly necessary, since your browser will assume 
# that http is used. However, if you need https or some other
# protocol, this is the field to adjust.

#image_map_protocol = http

# These values, when defined, will be added to each
# x,y coordinate of the map element boundary. These offsets
# are useful if the Circos image will be composited with
# another image, or cropped, or manipulated in any manner
# that shifts its original (0,0) (upper left) corner. You
# can define one or both values, and they can be negative.

#image_map_xshift = 0
#image_map_yshift = 0

# These factors will be used to multiply the x,y coordinates for each
# map element boundary. These parameters are useful if you are going
# to resize the image later. For example, if you create a 3000 x 3000
# pixel image (radius=1500px), but publish a 800 x 800 pixel image,
# set both factors to 800/3000 = 2.666667. Unless you are stretching
# the image (don't do it!) both factors should have the same value

#image_map_xfactor = 0.266667
#image_map_yfactor = 0.266667

# For debugging purposes, you can overlay the image map elements on
# top of the PNG image (not SVG). Each element in the overlay can have
# a fill color and stroke color. Note that if you add any x/y shift or
# multiplicative factors (above) then the overlay will reflect those
# factors.
